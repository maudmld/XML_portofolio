The source materials chosen for the XML project consist of three letters selected from the archives of Jean-Michel and Nicole Thierry,
which are preserved at the Institut national d’histoire de l’art in Paris. The Thierrys have led significant research in history of
art in the field of Eastern christian heritage, and contributed to document the medieval arts in the Caucasus region. 
Those three letters, dated from various periods of time and addressed to different specialists of the field (fellow international 
researchers, students and government or institutions officials), allow a better understanding of their scientific activity and 
their place within the network of actors engaged in the preservation of the cultural heritage of the region. 

The XML treatment of these few selected letters appears fundamental in order to share knowledge with a wider category of 
readers and will allow in the future more activity around the archival fund. Those letters were selected in order to illustrate
the diversity of topics, actors and activities that constitutes their research career. Their treatment by XML will also help 
the creation of prosopographic database, sites index and events by creating tags (as of now the tags person, site and event).

AI statement : I used generative AI trough the conversational assistant Mistral.ai in order to understand wether it was possible 
to add a TEI header while keeping my personalized Doctype declaration. After a few trials I decided not to pursue with the TEI 
header since my DTD file was customed to my sources.
